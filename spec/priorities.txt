Fast Decompression over High Compression Rates.

Low overhead asset fetching.

The loader knows where all the data is, after creation.

Designed for use in games and other realtime software. Where the application holds a file handle, or any equivalent handle, throughout much of it's relevancy.
Therefore the loader caches leaf(archive member) locations and entry data in an associative hash-map. This is unnecessary over-head
for single transmission or storage. It works particularly well if the data is fetched multiple times and the archive handle remains hot for long. Like in games.

Space efficient. Note this does not mean high compression. It means that no bytes in the archive are useless, and space is utilized aggressively.
For example, using 16-bit unsigned integers (u16), to denote ID lengths. This limits the max length of any ID to 65535 (u16::MAX), as IDs larger than this are completely unreasonable.
